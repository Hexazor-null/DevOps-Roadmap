# Shell Scripting to DevOps Expert — Learning Roadmap

This roadmap describes **the stages you should follow to master Shell Scripting and grow into a DevOps Expert**. It focuses on *what to learn*, *why it matters*, and *what skills you should gain* at each stage.

---

## Stage 0 — Linux & CLI Foundations

**Goal:** Become comfortable living in the terminal.

### Topics

* Linux filesystem structure (`/`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/home`)
* Basic commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`
* File viewing: `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`
* Permissions & ownership: `chmod`, `chown`, `umask`
* Package managers (apt, yum)

### Outcome

* Navigate Linux confidently
* Understand how files and permissions work

---

## Stage 1 — Shell Scripting Fundamentals

**Goal:** Write basic shell scripts that automate tasks.

### Topics

* What is Shell & Bash
* Script structure & shebang
* Variables & environment variables
* User input (`read`)
* Command substitution
* Exit codes

### Outcome

* Create simple scripts
* Automate repetitive terminal tasks

---

## Stage 2 — Control Flow & Logic

**Goal:** Add intelligence to scripts.

### Topics

* Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Test operators (`-f`, `-d`, `-z`, `-n`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`, `until`)
* Case statements

### Outcome

* Scripts that make decisions
* Handle multiple conditions

---

## Stage 3 — Text Processing Mastery

**Goal:** Analyze logs and data like a DevOps engineer.

### Topics

* `grep` (searching & filtering)
* `awk` (field processing)
* `sed` (stream editing)
* `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `cut`, `tr`
* Pipes & redirection

### Outcome

* Analyze large log files
* Build command pipelines

---

## Stage 4 — Functions & Script Design

**Goal:** Write clean, reusable scripts.

### Topics

* Functions
* Arguments (`$1`, `$@`, `$#`)
* Return values & exit status
* Error handling
* Logging techniques

### Outcome

* Modular scripts
* Professional-quality automation

---

## Stage 5 — System Automation

**Goal:** Control and monitor Linux systems.

### Topics

* Process management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)
* Services (`systemctl`, `service`)
* Cron jobs & scheduling
* Disk & memory monitoring
* Backup scripts

### Outcome

* Automate system maintenance
* Monitor servers

---

## Stage 6 — Networking & Security

**Goal:** Operate safely in production systems.

### Topics

* Networking commands (`ss`, `netstat`, `curl`, `wget`)
* SSH automation
* Firewall basics
* Secure scripting practices
* Secrets & environment management

### Outcome

* Manage remote servers
* Write secure scripts

---

## Stage 7 — DevOps Integration

**Goal:** Use shell scripting in real DevOps workflows.

### Topics

* CI/CD scripting
* Docker & container automation
* Git hooks
* Infrastructure provisioning scripts
* Environment bootstrapping

### Outcome

* Automate deployment pipelines
* Integrate scripts into DevOps tools

---

## Stage 8 — DevOps Expert Level

**Goal:** Design reliable, scalable automation systems.

### Topics

* Idempotent scripting
* Observability & monitoring integration
* Advanced debugging
* Performance optimization
* Shell vs Python decisions

### Outcome

* Production-grade automation
* Senior / Expert DevOps skillset

---

## Final Result

By completing all stages:

* You think in automation-first mindset
* You can analyze systems & logs fast
* You are job-ready for DevOps / SRE roles

---

**Next Step:** Start at Stage 0 and practice every concept with real scripts.
